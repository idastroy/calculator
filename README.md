The Odin Project: Foundations 
Final project - create a calculator

This project was very challenging but I am so proud of it! My code is clean and easy to read. I used very minimal HTML, all buttons were created using Javascript. I had so much fun with the CSS, I tried to make the calculator look at realistic as possible. 

The functionality of the calculator took the most time. When I got stuck sometimes I would close my laptop and write down my thoughts on a piece of paper, or try to explain the functions outloud to my husband. It helped a lot.

There are a few bugs on this calculator that I cannot figure out:

Keyboard support - I left my code for this commented out. I tried everything! But for some reason the display box reads "undefined" when a keyboard button is pressed. It was taking me too long so I have to move on. If anyone can offer advice please do!

Operator functionality - The user should be able to change the operator value on consecutive clicks (ex: if you press 3 + - * - + * 6, the calculator should operate on the last operator clicked and equate to 18). I couldn't figure this out.
